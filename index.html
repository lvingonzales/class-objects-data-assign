I used the library d3.js for the first time to crate two interactive donut charts to highlight and display the different groups. Hovering over a pie section will highlight that section and change the informational display next to it to show my own personal observations of the data.</p></div><div class="section where"><div class="description"><p class="heading">Where</p><p class="sub-heading"></p><p class="info">This chart shows a total of the countries from which each object originates, hover over a category to see some observations of the data.</p></div><div class="chart"></div></div><div class="section how"><div class="chart"></div><div class="description"><p class="heading">How</p><p class="sub-heading"></p><p class="info">This chart shows a total of the method by which each object was obtained, hover over a category to see some observations of the data.</p></div></div><div class="section more"><p class="heading">More Info</p><div class="sub-section"><div class="sub-section info"><p class="sub-heading">Why</p><p class="info">I chose to use the country of origin as one of my attributes because I have a fascination with other countries and cultures and thought it would be interesting to look for trends that arise from where our things come from.</p><p class="info">As for the "how we got them" attribute, that branched off of a thought I had in the last class where I assumed that a large number of objects would be gifts due to the recent Christmas season, an assumption that according to the data I was wrong about.</p></div><div class="sub-section info"><p class="sub-heading">How</p><p class="info">On the topic of how I created my visualizations, I first extracted some of the filtered data and placed it into a filter ".csv" file. This would allow me an easier time extracting the information I needed by changing some of the headings and adding descriptions to each entry.</p><p class="info">I then used the d3.js library to create and draw the chart to the screen, filling in the data from the two datasets and applying some interactivity to each of the elements for some visual flair. Lastly the information such as this paragraph you are reading was added in using static HTML</p></div></div></div><footer>Liam Gonzales</footer></div></body></html>
